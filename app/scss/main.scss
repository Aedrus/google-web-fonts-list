// REMINDER: When we use "@use" we are bringing a style into a file to be used in that specific file. When we use "@forward" we are bringing a specific style into a file and then send them out as one style (ex. the index file). The index file is used for collecting the partials within a folder and when you call that folder the index file is used and calls all partials forwarded within the index.
